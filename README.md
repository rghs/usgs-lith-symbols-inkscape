# USGS FGDC Lithological log symbols for Inkscape
This is an adaptation of the USGS Lithological symbols for igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks (https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/fgdc_gds/geolsymstd.php), provided by the USGS as AI and EPS files. Inkscape uses a slightly obscure mechanism for importing pattern libraries for use in your documents, so I've put the time into adapting the patterns to be drag and drop.

This was made readily possible by the work of the Univerisity of Otago (https://blogs.otago.ac.nz/si-geology/resources/illustrationgraphics-resources/usgs-inkscape-pack-instructions-and-download-link/) and cecgeology (https://github.com/cecgeology/USGS-FGDC).

## Use
To import these files into Inkscape for easy use, download either which is of interest and place it in the `paints` directory of Inkscape. This can be located by opening the application, and navigating to `Edit > Preferences > System` and and locating the entry for 'User Paint Servers'.

## Rights
The USGS Symbols are distributed under a public domain license, and this repo is marked with the Unlicense.
